Project Name - Eat-Da-Burger
Description: Creating a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Following the MVC (Model, View, Controllers) design pattern and using Node + MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
